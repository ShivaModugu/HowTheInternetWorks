                            <p>In this day and age data is king. Since the use of the internet has surged within the past decade so has the information stored within it, such as private data such as credit card numbers, passwords, bank information, and emails. Fortunately for encryption we don’t have to worry as much. Encryption is the process of scrambling or changing a message in order to hide the content. This kind of process dates way back to when Julius Caesar was the emperor of Rome. He used to send encrypted messages to his battle commanders incase his letter was intercepted by the enemies. This was known as the Caesar’s Cipher. The commanders who were sent the encrypted message had to know how to decrypt the message as well. The sender (Caesar) and the receiver (battle commanders) established a number and that was known as the key to decipher the message.

                            <p>Using a 10-digit key would mean there would be over 10 billion possible key solutions. A computer in today’s world would be able to crack this key in seconds. Encryption today is a lot more advanced than what Caesar used centuries ago. Computers encrypt our data with 256 bit keys which makes our data very secure. One thing to take notice is that if we keep inhibiting exponential growth within computer science and computer hardware begins to become faster and more advanced. The 256 bit encryption could ultimately become obsolete. </p>

                            <p> Symmetric encryption is essentially the modernized version of Caesar’s cipher. This would mean you would need to establish a key with the party you’re exchanging messages to. Asymmetric Encryption is what computers use which enables a public key that can  be shared with anyone enabling anyone to encrypt a message, but the computer also has  private key that can only be decrypted by a computer with access. SSL and TLS are security protocols that protect us when we’re surfing the web. This is the lock on the top left of the web address to display your data is secured and encrypted. </p>
